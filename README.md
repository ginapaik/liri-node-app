# Overview

In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

1. my-tweets uses the Twitter Node Package Manager (NPM) to create a function -- myTweets -- that pulls my specific user name's Tweets from the returned object.
2. spotify-this-song uses the Spotify NPM to create a function -- spotifyThisSong -- to pull specific information from the returned object based on the song the user asks for.
3. movie-this uses the Request NPM to pull specific data from the OMDB database for the user-specified movie.
4. The do-what-it-says command uses fs.write to write to the random.txt file in my directory.
